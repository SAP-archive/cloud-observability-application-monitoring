## 1. Introduction to SAP Hybrid Supportability
SAP customers that are using SAP Solution Manager for their operations can leverage the hybrid supportability offerings.
Here are the main 4 capabilities that are relevant for monitoring applications running on the SAP Cloud Platform:
  * [Integration monitoring](https://help.sap.com/viewer/82f6dd44db4e4518aad4dfce00116fcf/7.2.05/en-US/5140d8bd-a295-4391-a3bf-d442bc2dcbe7.html): to ensure reliable data exchange between SAP on-premise and cloud.
  * [Trace analysis](https://help.sap.com/viewer/82f6dd44db4e4518aad4dfce00116fcf/7.2.05/en-US/24549de5-a335-4cef-9127-cff2d309852d.html): to trace performance of applications based on exposed statistics.
  * [User monitoring](https://help.sap.com/viewer/82f6dd44db4e4518aad4dfce00116fcf/7.2.05/en-US/ef80f08c-5e3a-4c29-903b-8338c66c0b38.html): to ensure availability and performance of SAP cloud scenarios from customer on-premise locations.
  * [Exception management](https://help.sap.com/viewer/82f6dd44db4e4518aad4dfce00116fcf/7.2.05/en-US/96847666-37fa-4e4f-a1a9-040d01b61469.html): to forward business-critical exceptions from SAP cloud to on-premise operations.

In the following exercises, we will focus on the trace analysis and show how to configure everything to analyse the hybrid application. At the end, we will be able to trace the request in order to get application performance data and insights about the request path.<br /><br />

> Hint: This [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/02/02/brief-overview-of-hybrid-supportability-options-for-sap-cloud-platform/) gives a nice overview of the SAP Hybrid Supportability features.
